The purpose behind this program is to keep track of my books. I want to know
which books I own, which I have under my possession, which have been lent out,
and whom is borrowing which book.

v2 I will add features to keep track of more information about the books in my possession
including books I myself have borrowed from others and who that book was borrowed from.
I also want to include how many copies I have of a single book.

v3 I will include in my library a wish list. I also want to include an author table
so that I can group books by author. The program will be capable of reporting how
many books of a series are in my collection and which ones are missing.
