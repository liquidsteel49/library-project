The purpose behind this program is to keep track of my comics. I want to know
which comics I own and which have been lent out. I want to have comic, writer, and illustrator tables. There should be an attribute in both writer and illustrator tables called "best_known_work". The comic tables should have an attribute with a synopsis and an attribute with genre. User should have CRUD capabilities.

v2 Including books I myself have borrowed from others and who that book was borrowed from.
I also want to include how many copies I have of a single book. The program will be capable of reporting how
many books of a series are in my collection and which ones are missing.

v3 Including books I myself have borrowed from others and who that book was borrowed from. I will include in my library a wish list.
